**Project Overview**

This project implements a content-based recommender system for movies using the TMDB dataset. The system analyzes movie metadata, extracts features, and provides personalized recommendations through similarity measures, deployed via a simple web app.

**Objectives**

•Build a content-based recommendation engine using TMDB dataset.

•Extract features from movie metadata and convert them into vector representations.

•Deploy an interactive web application for user-friendly movie recommendations.

**Tools & Technologies**

•Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)

•CountVectorizer for text feature extraction

•Cosine Similarity for recommendation engine

•Streamlit for web app deployment

**Key Features**

•Data cleaning and preprocessing of TMDB dataset.

•Feature extraction using CountVectorizer to represent movies as vectors.

•Cosine similarity to recommend movies based on content.

•Streamlit-based interactive web app for real-time recommendations.
